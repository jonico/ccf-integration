For new developers:

	How to setup source code:

		1.CCF-Integration project uses Spring Tool Suite(STS) eclipse(version 2.8 or greater) for development.
			Download Link -> https://sagan-production.cfapps.io/tools
		2.Checkout the source code from the repo and import the project as gradle project.
		3.To install and set up Gradle and its plugin in STS eclipse, Please visit our WIKI link given below.
			https://ctf.open.collab.net/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.ccf/wiki/BuildBundleAndPackageCCFMasterWithThirdPartyGenericParticipant
		4.Follow STS eclipse based menu options to import the project.
			File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle project -> select the project -> Build Model ->Finish
		5.Above said options also works for importing individual plugin i.e.plugins/TFS as a separate project for development.
		6.Once import Gradle eclipse will automatically resolve the dependencies needed for compiling the project locally in your system.

	To send patch for review to the community:

		1.Make sure your code follows our code style configuration defined.
		2.Make sure all unit test case followed runs successfully.
		3.Finally Create a patch and send it to our development mailing list.					
					
		
	Code style configuration:
	
		Any java code implemented in CCF-Integration/plugins/<participant-Name> project should  follow java code style conventions defined and used in other CCF projects.
		So from STS eclipse we have exported the code style formatting configuration into a config file (available as part of this project).
		Developers need to follow the steps mentioned below to configure and to use it.
		
		1.Import the Code style configuration file "ccf-formatter.xml".To import follow steps in STS eclipse.				
			Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> import 
		2.Also configure Member sort order(this is to align and order variable and methods).Following changes needs to be applied.
			Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Appearance -> Member Sort Order
		3.In Member Sort Order dialog window correct sequential order as mentioned below 
			Types,Fields,Static Fields,Initializers,Static Initializers,Constructor,Methods,Static Methods
		4.Also in Member Sort Order dialog window enable "Sort members in same category by visibility" option and correct the order as given below.
			Public,Protected,Private,Default  
		5.Manually each developer as to format(CTRL+SHIFT+F) the java source code.
			Select the project -> RightClck ->Source -> Format  
		6.To sort the order of the members present in the java source code.
			Select the project -> RightClck ->Source -> Sort Member
